    <h2>💌 A Letter to My Drishika</h2>
    <p>
      My dearest Montu,<br><br>
      No..No..No… my <strong>Sunshine</strong>, the light of my world 🌞<br><br>
      I know you're upset right now, and maybe I deserve it. I’ve again messed up. I’ve again hurt the one person I never wanted to see sad—not even for a moment. And for that, I’m truly, deeply sorry. (again)<br><br>
      You mean the world to me, and yet sometimes I fail to show you just how much. But I need you to know this: I  <strong>crazily beg for your attention </strong>. I want to be the one who lingers in your thoughts. I want to be that little voice in your heart saying, <em>“He’s thinking of me right now.”</em> Because I am. Every moment.<br><br>
      I want to be the only one whose name makes your heart skip. I want to be the one who lives in your smile and sleeps in your arms. I want you to know, I really don't want anyone who will have your 1% attention. I only want to <strong>make you mine</strong><br>
      And honestly… if I could choose how to go, it would be <strong>laying in your lap</strong>, with your fingers in my hair, whispering that everything is okay again. That you still love me.<br><br>
      You’re my everything, Drishika. The one I adore, protect, cherish… and sometimes unintentionally hurt. But I promise, I’ll learn again. I’ll grow more. I’ll never stop trying to be the boyfriend you deserve.<br><br>
      Until your anger melts and your smile returns, I’ll be waiting here… with arms full of love, and a heart that belongs only to you.<br><br>
      Forever yours,<br>
      <strong>Pookie 💘</strong>
    </p>
